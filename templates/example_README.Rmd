# ohwhaley  

Whale-come! This R package was inspired by [cowsay](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay) and [praise](https://github.com/rladies/praise). I hope this package made you smile today! 

## First things first

`ohwhaley` is a toy project and is still under development. You can install the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, install, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fontikar/ohwhaley")
```

## Take it for a spin

`ohwhaley` contains one function only. `say()` will echo a randomly chosen whale-themed phrase for your enjoyment.

```{r example}
library(ohwhaley)
 
say() 
```

Alternatively, you can supply your own phrase

```{r, customise}
say("I'm beached as bro!!!")
```
